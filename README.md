# Speed-Dating-Popularity
 
In this project, I'm using selected columns from a speed dating dataset to predict someone's success in a speed dating event without knowing the results or interactions at the event (data leakage). I'm defining successful here as getting 'likes' from half of the participants of the opposite sex. 

Please refer to the PDF file for results and overview of the project.
